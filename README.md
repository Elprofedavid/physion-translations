# Physion Translations

This repository contains translation files used in [Physion](https://app.physion.net)

## Adding a Translation

In order to add a new Physion translation, the following steps need to be followed:

- Create a fork of this repo
- Copy and rename [Translations/en.json](./Translations/en.json) to match the language you're traslating to. 
  - Use the [standard language code](https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/) of the language you're translating to when renaming the file.
  - For example, if you're translating into japanese then you need use `ja.json` as the filename.
- Translate the contents of the new file
  - You only need to translate the values (and not the keys) of the translation file
- Open a Pull Request to merge the new translation file.

## Updating a Translation

In case you want to update an existing translation (either because some text is not translated or because something is wrongly translated) you need to follow
a similar process as explained above. The only difference is that your changes will be on an existing file.
